### Libraries and Models
- Imports necessary libraries, including `cv2` for OpenCV.
- Defines a function `faceBox` that uses a pre-trained face detection model (`faceNet`) to detect faces in a given frame. It draws bounding boxes around detected faces and returns the modified frame along with the bounding box coordinates.

### Model Files
- Specifies paths to model files (`faceProto`, `faceModel`, `ageProto`, `ageModel`, `genderProto`, `genderModel`) required for face detection, age detection, and gender detection.

### Initialization
- Loads the neural networks using `cv2.dnn.readNet` for face detection (`faceNet`), age estimation (`ageNet`), and gender classification (`genderNet`).
- Defines lists (`age_list`, `gender_list`) for interpreting model predictions.

### Video Capture and Processing Loop
- Opens a video capture stream from the default webcam (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).
- In a loop:
  - Reads frames from the video stream.
  - Uses the `faceBox` function to detect faces in the frame and obtain bounding box coordinates.
  - For each detected face:
    - Extracts the face region.
    - Preprocesses the face image (`blobFromImage` function) for age and gender prediction.
    - Performs inference using `genderNet` and `ageNet` to predict gender and age.
    - Draws the predicted gender and age as text on the frame near the corresponding face.
  - Displays the annotated frame (`frame`) in a window named "ProjectGurukul Age-Gender".
  - Checks for user input (`'q'` key) to exit the loop.

### Display and Cleanup
- Releases the video capture object (`video.release()`).
- Closes all OpenCV windows (`cv2.destroyAllWindows()`).

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the paths to the model files (`*.pbtxt`, `*.caffemodel`) are correct and accessible from your working directory.
- The age and gender predictions are based on pre-trained models (`age_net.caffemodel` and `gender_net.caffemodel`) and corresponding prototxt files.
- Adjustments may be needed for optimal performance depending on the webcam's resolution and lighting conditions.

This script demonstrates a practical application of deep learning for real-time face analysis using OpenCV, making it suitable for various applications such as demographic analysis, audience measurement, or personalized user experiences.
